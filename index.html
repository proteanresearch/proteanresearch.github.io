  <!-- THE CHALLENGE OF DRUG ESCAPE -->
  <section class="content">
    <h2>The Challenge of Drug Escape</h2>
    <p>
      Cancer is notoriously adaptable. Even when a therapy initially appears effective, 
      many tumors find ways to evade its impact. This <strong>drug escape</strong> 
      results in cancer progression and often requires new or additional treatments. 
      As the number of approved oncology drugs grows, understanding and predicting how 
      tumors might outmaneuver each agent becomes increasingly vital.

  <!-- THE GROWING LANDSCAPE OF ONCOLOGY THERAPIES -->
  <section class="content">
    <h2>The Growing Landscape of Oncology Therapies</h2>
    <p>
      Over the next few years, <strong>many new oncology therapies</strong> will reach 
      the market, offering unprecedented options for patients and clinicians. However, 
      with such a rapidly expanding toolkit, clinicians face a daunting challenge: 
      <em>how to identify the most potent drug or combination of drugs for each specific 
      tumor profile</em>. Traditional diagnostic models have not kept pace with this 
      expansion, leaving an urgent need for more sophisticated approaches.

  <!-- DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES LAG BEHIND -->
  <section class="content">
    <h2>Diagnostic Approaches Lag Behind</h2>
    <p>
      Despite significant advances in <strong>analytical techniques</strong>—from 
      genomics and proteomics to novel imaging methods—diagnostic innovations in 
      oncology have <em>not kept up</em>. Existing companion diagnostics are typically 
      tied to individual drugs or specific biomarkers, and do not address the broader, 
      cross-cancer need to <strong>rationally select among multiple therapies</strong>. 
      As a result, patients often miss the optimal therapeutic combination because 
      today’s diagnostics offer only limited guidance.

  <!-- OUR FOCUS ON COMBINATION THERAPIES -->
  <section class="content">
    <h2>Our Focus on Combination Therapies</h2>
    <p>
      Evidence shows that <strong>pairing patients with the best possible combination of therapies</strong> 
      yields the greatest impact on long-term outcomes. Yet, funding and development 
      resources have traditionally flowed toward drug discovery and development rather 
      than <em>diagnostic innovation</em>. Protean Research fills this critical gap by 
      leveraging advanced analytical techniques and data-driven models to match each 
      patient’s cancer profile to the <strong>most promising therapy combination</strong>.
