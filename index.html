    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Protean Research Inc. is dedicated to developing novel diagnostics to inform the selection of
      combination therapies for cancer patients. Our mission is to enable clinicians to optimize treatment
      strategies by matching each patient to the most effective blend of therapies, accelerating progress toward
      better outcomes for all.

  <!-- THE CHALLENGE SECTION -->
  <section class="parallax" style="background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1590502593730-e1aef5ed5f0c?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80');">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Drug escape in oncology</strong> is a major hurdle. Cancer cells evolve quickly and can become
        resistant to single-agent therapies, rendering once-effective treatments less successful over time. The
        rapid development and approval of new oncology drugs – with many more in the pipeline – make it increasingly
        difficult to determine which therapies or combinations will deliver the best results. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Diagnostic approaches have not kept pace with the explosion of new treatments and sophisticated 
        analytical technologies that have emerged in the last two decades. While large resources are devoted to 
        drug discovery and drug development, comparatively fewer efforts focus on guiding clinicians and patients 
        toward the right combination regimens. This gap in innovative diagnostic solutions perpetuates suboptimal 
        patient outcomes and limits the potential of cutting-edge therapies.

  <!-- SOLUTION SECTION -->
  <section id="solution">
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
      At Protean Research, we believe that the most impactful way to improve patient outcomes is by pairing 
      individuals with the best combination of therapies. Unlike many manufacturers who focus on companion 
      diagnostics for their specific drug candidates, our cross-cancer, universal approach aims to guide 
      therapy selection at a broader level, ensuring that every patient receives a rational, data-driven 
      combination of treatments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our platform integrates cutting-edge molecular diagnostics, advanced analytics, and a systematic evaluation 
      of existing and emerging therapeutics. By partnering with leading academic institutions, clinical centers, 
      and pharmaceutical innovators, we are creating a powerful diagnostic ecosystem that can keep pace with 
      the rapidly evolving oncology landscape.
