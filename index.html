    <h2>The Challenge: Overcoming Drug Escape in Oncology</h2>
    <p>
      As cancer therapies become more sophisticated, malignant cells still find ways to resist even the most potent treatments. 
      This phenomenon, often called <strong>drug escape</strong>, allows tumors to adapt and evolve, diminishing the effectiveness of 
      single treatments or even combination regimens over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a surge of novel oncology drugs hitting the market, clinicians have an ever-expanding toolbox. Yet the complexity of 
      tumor biology means there is no simple “one-size-fits-all” approach. Instead, each patient’s tumor may require unique 
      therapeutic cocktails, and finding the right combination is a significant challenge.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="future">
    <h2>Growth in Novel Oncology Therapies</h2>
    <p>
      The oncology pipeline is more robust than ever. Over the next few years, a large number of new oncology therapies—ranging from 
      targeted small molecules to cell-based immunotherapies—are expected to receive regulatory approval. While this breadth of 
      options promises new hope for patients, it also introduces significant complexity when deciding among multiple treatment 
      pathways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The central question for clinicians remains: <em>Which therapy or combination of therapies will offer the best outcomes for this 
      specific patient?</em> 
    </p>

  <section id="diagnostics-gap">
    <h2>The Diagnostics Gap</h2>
    <p>
      Despite remarkable advances in research tools—single-cell sequencing, CRISPR-based screens, high-throughput imaging, and 
      more—<strong>diagnostic approaches in routine oncology practice have not kept pace</strong>. Tumor profiling often remains 
      limited to a narrow panel of known mutations, missing the broader molecular and cellular context that influences treatment 
      response and resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve the puzzle of drug escape and optimal therapy selection, the diagnostic industry must leverage the full power of 
      these emerging analytical techniques and integrate them into clinical practice in a rigorous yet accessible way.
